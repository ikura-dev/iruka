# Iruka

## What is Iruka?

Iruka is a platform for discovering and listing issues within communities.

## How to use Iruka

### Searching

http://iruka.techseve.com

As simple as searching for an organization.

Searches are case insensitive and you do not need to include an `@` at the beginning of the name.

All of the following would equate to `makeschool`:

* MakeSchool
* make school
* @makeschool


### Query opt-in

1. Make sure you have an organization associated with your account
   1. ![view profile button](/images/step-one.png) Navigate to your profile 
   2. ![edit profile button](/images/step-two.png) Edit your profile 
   3. ![organization field](/images/step-three.png) Make sure you have a single organization, case-insensitive, `@` agnostic, in your profile (Iruka currently only supports single organizations)
2. :star2: Star this repo to opt-in and make your issues visible! :star2:
